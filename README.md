FFmpeg GUI (Rust + egui Portable Tool)
======================================

This is just a quick GUI I made for FFmpeg since i hated that the now multi planetary standard (real) is exclusively CLI. It's bad and early, eventually ill get to adding more stuffs.

Built in Rust using egui

Features:
- Extract audio as many codecs
- Compress videos with H.264
- Repackage into MP4 or MKV
- Frame rate control
- Collapsible advanced options
- Much more to come (whenever I feel like it

How to Use:
-----------
1. Download the ZIP
2. Run ffmpeg_gui.exe
3. Profit! (hopefully)

Requirements:
-------------
- No install required. No admin rights needed. (I think)
- ffmpeg.exe and ffprobe.exe must be present. (included)
